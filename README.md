# Web-scraping-to-extract-premiums-on-Silver
There are always premiums attached to buying precious metals physically. Generally, it is closer to the spot price for gold than for silver. During the corona crisis the premiums for silver have increased a lot. So, it would be interesting to see how the premiums of silver a changing over time.

Iâ€™ve been manually downloading the html of a website (<a href='https://www.gold.de/aufgeldtabelle/silber/'>Gold.de</a>), where the premiums of silver are shown for different products.

This repo contains a python script that downloads the data from the website, transforms it into a pandas DataFrame and gives you a csv file with the cleaned data.
The script needs to be activated from n environment which has python, pandas and numpy installed.

The goal is that the script runs each day automatically.

In the repo there is also a jupyter notebook where I used regular expressions to extract more informations from the product column, like product name, weight of coin/bar and retailer.
